      <title>A Visit to Suther Prairie</title>

      <description>Last month, I finally had the privilege to visit Suther prairie in Cabarrus county, North Carolina as part of a NC Botanical Garden field trip. I had been wanting to visit this site since learning about it a few years ago from Tompkins et al paper on the flora of the site. Until recently acquired by the state, this site has been held by the same family since the 1700s and not been plowed in all those years.</description>

      <description>Love this from @DukeGardens. Let&amp;#39;s turn more medians into pocket prairies full of native plants! üòçüåæüåª https://t.co/vopsfWT5Ix
&amp;mdash; NC Botanical Garden (@NCBotGarden) December 16, 2020 Following the success of Sarah P. Duke Gardens‚Äô Piedmont Prairie in the Blomquist Garden, the horticulture staff is experimenting with ‚Äúprairie pockets‚Äù in parking lot medians. The results look great so far!</description>

      <description>During late Spring and early Summer, butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) is a common splash of color on Piedmont roadsides and old fields. This milkweed typically only grows to a couple of feet high, unlike another Piedmont resident common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), which reach 4-5 feet tall in unmown rights-of-way. Milkweed leaves are an important food source for caterpillars of the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The sweet nectar of Milkweeds attracts many pollinators including bees, wasps, flies, beetles, ants, and more.</description>

      <description>Greater tickseed (Coreopsis major) and many other members of the Asteraceae are common Piedmont roadside inhabitants. This plant typically only reaches up to 3 feet in height. But with its striking, large yellow flowers, greater tickseed can stand out along roadside edges. Unlike species like Wild Quinine, the native range of Greater tickseed only extends into Louisiana and not into the Mid-West plains.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re unlikely to see Piedmont Barbara&amp;rsquo;s buttons (Marshallia obovata) without looking for it. This plant rarely grows more than a couple of feet high. The late Spring, white flowers do not always stand out like the yellow flowers of many Asteraceae. Visit the Piedmont habitat at the North Carolina Botanical Garden in late May though, and you&amp;rsquo;re sure to find Barbara&amp;rsquo;s buttons in bloom.</description>

      <description>Wild quinine (Parthenium integrifolium) is commonly found on roadsides and rights-of-way in the Piedmont. It is the most observed species in the NC Piedmont Roadside Native Plant project on iNaturalist, which has been running since 2016. This member of the Asteraceae family is not particularly showy, but it&amp;rsquo;s presence often indicates a quality habitat for other sun-loving prairie plants. The native range of wild quinine extends from the Piedmont through prairie states as far north as Minnesota.</description>

      <description>Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) is a small tree that can thrive in poor soils. This tree&amp;rsquo;s thick bark and waxy leaves makes it tolerant of fire. Blackjack oak and other fire-resistant trees are often associated with open, savanna habitat. The Southern Piedmont Pine-Oak Savannas project has documented over 800 species of plants found in these open habitats.</description>

      <description>Along with big bluestem and indiangrass, little bluestem is a characteristic species of the tallgrass prairie. However, its range extends well beyond the Midwestern prairies and is found throughout the Piedmont and Eastern United States. Little bluestem is the larval host for several insects, including many skippers, a family of butterflies. The grass forms bunches whose subtle bluish hue can give Piedmont old fields a ocean-like feel in midsummer.</description>

      <description>Like little bluestem, indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) is characteristic tallgrass prairie grass also common in the Piedmont. Where indiangrass has formed large colonies, the seed heads provide stunning visual interest to roadsides in the Fall.</description>

      <description>There are many asters native to the Piedmont Prairie, but largeflower aster (Symphyotrichum grandiflorum) is endemic to the Piedmont and parts of the Coastal Plain. This plant can be prolific with its purple flowers, making it easy to spot for the keen eye when it blooms in early Fall. This species is listed as vulnerable by the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program.</description>

      <description>A common myth is that colonizers of the Southeastern Piedmont reached a vast, unbroken forest. Some have claimed that a a squirrel could cross the Piedmont from mountains to the coastal plain and ‚Äúnever have seen a flicker of sunshine on the ground‚Äù (J. T. Adams 2012; as quoted in Brown et al. 2000). Recent academic literature refers to the pre-colonial Piedmont region as ‚ÄúSouthern Forest‚Äù (e.g., Sanderson et al.</description>
