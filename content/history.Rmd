Let me introduce the Natural History of the Piedmont Prairie with a bit of personal history. My interest in the flora of the Piedmont Prairie began with a childhood awe of fauna. To this day, I remember seeing bison at [Charles Towne Landing]([https://southcarolinaparks.com/see-and-do/wildlife/the-animal-forest-at-charles-towne-landing]) during an elementary school field trip and learning that early European colonists may have encountered these massive herbivores. The thought of bison wandering through the same Loblolly pine and Oak-Hickory forests that I wandered through lit this young boy's imagination.

Historical evidence suggests American Bison ranged widely across the Southeast during at least the 16th and 17th centuries [@rostlund1960the-geographic]. To have been successful, bison would have needed large tracts of open, grassy areas. Despite the myth that [a squirrel could cross the Piedmont from mountains to the coastal plain across a sea of trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXJmR1GjE50) and academic literature that refers to the pre-colonial Piedmont region as "Southern Forest" [e.g., @sanderson2008the-ecological], a more accurate [biogeographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography) historical depiction of the [Piedmont region](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807846711/field-guide-to-the-piedmont/) is a mosaic of many habitats including forests, savannas, and what we now call the *Piedmont Prairie*.

# Prairie Extent

The US Environmental Protection Agency defines the [Piedmont Eco-region](https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america) as extending from near Montogomery, AL northeastward across Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia to Washington, DC. The eastern border of the region is the [Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard_Fall_Line). To the West, the Appalachian Mountains rise out of the Piedmont's rolling hills.

The precise extent of prairie-like habitat prior to European settlement is unknown, but sample historical evidence suggests open habitat was common. In a seminal monograph on the  historical of vegetation in the Southeast, @rostlund1957myth writes:

> On a vegetation map of the ancient Southeast, if such a map could be constructed from the early records, there would be some areas in dark green color to show the dense and mature forests, other areas in light green to represent the open woodlands, and the map would be liberally flecked with yellow to indicate the scattered tracts of open country. 

# Factors that created prairie-like habitat

## Edaphic 

## Land use practices Indigenous cultures

## Fire

## Herbivores




# Biodiversity

* endangered species
   * sunflower



# Where is the prairie now?

The Piedmont region is notably developed:

* development
* population
* fragmentation


## Roadsides & Rights-of-Way

## Conservation of the piedmont prairie
