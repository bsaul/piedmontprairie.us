Let me introduce the Natural History of the Piedmont Prairie with a bit of personal history. My interest in the flora of the Piedmont Prairie began with my childhood awe of fauna. To this day, I remember seeing bison at [Charles Towne Landing]([https://southcarolinaparks.com/see-and-do/wildlife/the-animal-forest-at-charles-towne-landing]) during an elementary school field trip and learning that early European colonists may have encountered these massive herbivores. The thought of bison wandering through the same Loblolly pine and Oak-Hickory forests that I wandered through lit this young boy's imagination.

Historical evidence suggests American Bison ranged widely across the Southeast during at least the 16th and 17th centuries [@rostlund1960the-geographic]. To have been successful, bison would have needed large tracts of open, grassy areas. Despite the myth that [a squirrel could cross the Piedmont from mountains to the coastal plain across a sea of trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXJmR1GjE50) and academic literature referring to the pre-colonial Piedmont region as "Southern Forest" [@sanderson2008the-ecological], a more accurate [biogeographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography) snapshot of the [Piedmont region](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807846711/field-guide-to-the-piedmont/) is a mosaic of many habitats including forests, savannas, and what we now call the *Piedmont Prairie*.
