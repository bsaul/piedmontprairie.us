Let me introduce the Natural History of the Piedmont Prairie with a bit of personal history. My interest in the flora of the Piedmont Prairie began with a childhood awe of fauna. To this day, I remember seeing bison at [Charles Towne Landing]([https://southcarolinaparks.com/see-and-do/wildlife/the-animal-forest-at-charles-towne-landing]) during an elementary school field trip and learning that early European colonists may have encountered these massive herbivores. The thought of bison wandering through the same Loblolly pine and Oak-Hickory forests that I wandered through lit this young boy's imagination.
