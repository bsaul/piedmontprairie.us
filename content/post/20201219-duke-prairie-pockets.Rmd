Following the success of Sarah P. Duke Gardens' [Piedmont Prairie](https://today.duke.edu/2015/06/prairie) in the [Blomquist Garden](https://gardens.duke.edu/about/blomquist-garden), the horticulture staff is experimenting with "prairie pockets" in parking lot medians. The results look great so far!
