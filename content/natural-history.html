<p>Historical evidence suggests American Bison ranged widely across the Southeast during at least the 16th and 17th centuries <span class="citation">(Rostlund 1960)</span>. To have been successful, bison would have needed large tracts of open, grassy areas. Despite the myth that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXJmR1GjE50">a squirrel could cross the Piedmont from mountains to the coastal plain across a sea of trees</a> and academic literature that refers to the pre-colonial Piedmont region as “Southern Forest” <span class="citation">(e.g., Sanderson et al. 2008)</span>, a more accurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography">biogeographic</a> historical depiction of the <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9780807846711/field-guide-to-the-piedmont/">Piedmont region</a> is a mosaic of many habitats including forests, savannas, and what we now call the <em>Piedmont Prairie</em>.</p>
<div id="prairie-extent" class="section level1">
<h1>Prairie Extent</h1>
<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency defines the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america">Piedmont Eco-region</a> as extending from near Montogomery, AL northeastward across Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia to Washington, DC. The eastern border of the region is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard_Fall_Line">Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line</a>. To the West, the Appalachian Mountains rise out of the Piedmont’s rolling hills.</p>
<p>The extent of prairie-like habitat prior to European settlement is unknown, but sample historical evidence suggests open habitat was common. In a seminal monograph on the historical of vegetation in the Southeast, <span class="citation">Rostlund (1957)</span> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a vegetation map of the ancient Southeast, if such a map could be constructed from the early records, there would be some areas in dark green color to show the dense and mature forests, other areas in light green to represent the open woodlands, and the map would be liberally flecked with yellow to indicate the scattered tracts of open country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These yellow flecks would be Piedmont prairie.</p>

<div id="factors-that-created-prairie-like-habitat" class="section level1">
<h1>Factors that created prairie-like habitat</h1>
<p>Five factors contributed to the formation and maintenance of open habitat in the Piedmont: soils, climate, fire, herbivores, and land-use practices. These are briefly described here, and the relative contribution of each factor to sustain prairie habitat probably varied greatly depending on the specific region and the vegetation community.</p>
