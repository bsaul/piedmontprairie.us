<p>Let me introduce the Natural History of the Piedmont Prairie with a bit of personal history. My interest in the flora of the Piedmont Prairie began with my childhood awe of fauna. To this day, I remember seeing bison at <a href="%5Bhttps://southcarolinaparks.com/see-and-do/wildlife/the-animal-forest-at-charles-towne-landing%5D">Charles Towne Landing</a> during an elementary school field trip and learning that early European colonists may have encountered these massive herbivores. The thought of bison wandering through the same Loblolly pine and Oak-Hickory forests that I wandered through lit this young boy’s imagination.</p>

<p>Historical evidence suggests American Bison ranged widely across the Southeast during at least the 16th and 17th centuries <span class="citation">(Rostlund 1960)</span>. To have been successful, bison would have needed large tracts of open, grassy areas. Despite the myth that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXJmR1GjE50">a squirrel could cross the Piedmont from mountains to the coastal plain across a sea of trees</a> and academic literature referring to the pre-colonial Piedmont region as “Southern Forest” <span class="citation">(Sanderson et al. 2008)</span>, a more accurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography">biogeographic</a> snapshot of the <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9780807846711/field-guide-to-the-piedmont/">Piedmont region</a> is a mosaic of many habitats including forests, savannas, and what we now call the <em>Piedmont Prairie</em>.</p>
