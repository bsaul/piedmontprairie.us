Wild quinine (*Parthenium integrifolium*) is commonly found on roadsides and rights-of-way in the Piedmont. It is the most observed species in the [NC Piedmont Roadside Native Plant](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/north-carolina-piedmont-roadside-native-plants) project on iNaturalist, which has been running since 2006. This member of the [Asteraceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteraceae) family is not particularly showy, but it's presence often indicates a quality habitat for other sun-loving prairie plants. The native range of wild quinine extends from the Piedmont through prairie states as far north as Minnesota.
