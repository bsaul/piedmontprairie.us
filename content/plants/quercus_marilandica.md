Blackjack oak (*Quercus marilandica*) is a small tree that can thrive in poor soils. This tree's thick bark and waxy leaves makes it tolerant of fire. Blackjack oak and other fire-resistant trees are often associated with open, savanna habitat. The [Southern Piedmont Pine-Oak Savannas project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/southern-piedmont-pine-oak-savannas) has documented over 800 species of plants found in these open habitats.
