Along with big bluestem and [indiangrass](../sorghastrum_nutans), little bluestem is a characteristic species of the [tallgrass prairie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallgrass_prairie). However, its range extends well beyond the Midwestern prairies and is found throughout the Piedmont and Eastern United States. Little bluestem is the larval host for several insects, including many [skippers](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/122603-Schizachyrium-scoparium#Ecology), a family of butterflies. The grass forms bunches whose subtle bluish hue can give Piedmont old fields a ocean-like feel in midsummer.
