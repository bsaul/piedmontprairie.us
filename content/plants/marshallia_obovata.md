You're unlikely to see Piedmont Barbara's buttons (*Marshallia obovata*) without looking for it. This plant rarely grows more than a couple of feet high. The late Spring, white flowers do not always stand out like the yellow flowers of many [Asteraceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteraceae). Visit the [Piedmont habitat](https://ncbg.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/963/2019/04/NCBG_MasterMap.pdf) at the North Carolina Botanical Garden in late May though, and you're sure to find Barbara's buttons in bloom.
