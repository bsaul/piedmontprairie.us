During late Spring and early Summer, butterfly weed (*Asclepias tuberosa*) is a common splash of color on Piedmont roadsides and old fields. This milkweed typically only grows to a couple of feet high, unlike another Piedmont resident common milkweed (*Asclepias syriaca*), which get to 4-5 feet in unmown rights-of-way. Milkweed leaves are an important food source for caterpillars of the Monarch butterfly (*Danaus plexippus*). The sweet nectar of Milkweeds attracts many pollinators including bees, wasps, flies, beetles, ants, and more.

Take a moment to closely examine milkweed flowers: they're beautiful!
