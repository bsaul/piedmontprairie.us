There are many asters native to the Piedmont Prairie, but largeflower aster (*Symphyotrichum grandiflorum*) is endemic to the Piedmont and parts of the Coastal Plain. This plant can be prolific with its purple flowers, making it easy to spot for the keen eye when it blooms in early Fall. This species is [listed as vulnerable](https://explorer.natureserve.org/Taxon/ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.133496/Symphyotrichum_grandiflorum) by the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program.
